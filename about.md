I write web applications, mostly in PHP and Javascript.  I used to be a bicycle mechanic.  I even earned my race license so I could work as a team mechanic for racing teams.  Eventually I got good enough at programming to do that full time, and here I am.

I used to live on a sailboat in Florida and write software for the public school system.  After that I lived in Silicon Valley writing APIs for a [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/) startup.  Now I'm back home in Western North Carolina building an off grid homestead.
